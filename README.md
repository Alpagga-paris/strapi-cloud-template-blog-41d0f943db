## Development guidelines 


### ‚úÖ Environment Strategy

**Staging/Production Resource Convention:**

- Each Strapi resource MUST have both staging and production versions
- This enables safe testing in staging before production deployment
- Create environment-specific endpoint variables to target appropriate resources

**Local Development Limitations:**

- Local Strapi is NOT linked to production/staging databases, as it use sqlLite in local
- You must recreate accounts and test resources locally
- Image URLs point to local filesystem paths (not production-ready)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Safety Rules

**Critical Deployment Guidelines:**

1. **Never rename or remove fields** before deploying corresponding code changes to production
2. Field modifications will **delete existing content** immediately upon deployment
3. Always coordinate field schema changes with code deployments
4. Test all schema changes thoroughly in staging environment first

Resource naming pattern:

- `staging-homepage` ‚Üí staging environment
- `production-homepage` ‚Üí production environment


## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

Deployment will happens when you push to main on repository.
